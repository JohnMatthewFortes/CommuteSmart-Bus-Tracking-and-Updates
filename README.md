# Public Transportation App

## Introduction

Public transportation systems are a vital transportation component for many commuters and travelers, however, these systems can face several challenges that can impact their efficiency and reliability. Several challenges can be seen in the uncertainty and inconsistencies of arrival and departure times of buses to and from their designated start and endpoints. This uncertainty leads to long waiting periods for arrival that are affected by different factors such as delays due to unpredictable traffic, and weather conditions. Traditional methods of displaying bus schedule systems that display the estimated arrival time of buses often fail in predicting and showing the real-time conditions and data that include delays in arrival due to several factors. The lack of accurate real-time data impedes reliability. It discourages commuters and travelers from taking public transport, showing the importance of having a robust solution that can optimize the public transportation experience.

This application aims to enhance the public transportation experience, specifically bus transportation experiences. Enhancing the transportation experience could encourage the use of transportation services such as buses more than the use of private vehicles in traveling and commuting. This could lead not only to the optimization of transportation experience but also to the optimization of traffic and the provision of a solution to different traffic and transportation problems. The goal of this project is to create a more efficient and reliable public transportation system and experience that meets the needs of daily commuters, occasional travelers, and tourists, thereby encouraging the use of public transportation and contributing to more sustainable urban mobility.


## Description

Public transportation provides mobility and transportation access to millions of people globally.  Bus transportation is a common means of transportation that many people use and experience. Aside from its affordability, it can accommodate several numbers of people larger than occasional public transport such as taxis and jeepneys. Due to this reason, a lot of people prefer taking buses when traveling into different cities resulting in long lines of passengers waiting in designated pickup points and terminals. 
	


## Features

- *Live Bus Tracking*: View real-time locations of buses on the map.
- *Route Information*: Detailed view of the route maps including start-point and end-points.
- *Estimated Arrival and Departure Time*: Predict the arrival of buses that are currently in transit to their destination by analyzing current traffic conditions.
- *Notifications and Alerts*: Receive updates on delays and route changes.
- *User-Friendly Experience*:  The interface of the application should provide a user-friendly interface that allows easy access for users of different ages. 

## Objectives

- Display the real-time location of buses currently in transit.
- Send notifications and alerts to users about delays due to traffic conditions.
- Provide accurate estimated arrival and departure times based on current traffic conditions.

## Motivation

The app aims to alleviate the challenge of boarding buses by offering real-time information and alerts, ensuring a smoother travel experience. Bus Company that was used as a reference for this project is the BSC - Batman Stareexpress Corp. Nasugbu to Batangas and vice versa.

## SIGNIFICANCE:

	Public transportation provides mobility and transportation access to millions of people, being a primary means of transportation. In particular, bus transportation is favored over other forms of public transportation, such as taxis and jeepneys due to its affordability and capacity. Enhancing the public bus transportation experience can result in shorter waiting times, more efficient route planning, and increased reliability, thus encouraging more people to use public transportation. This can help reduce traffic congestion and contribute to more sustainable urban mobility. Enhancing the bus transportation experience can lead to significant benefits:

- *Increased Public Transport Use* - Reliable and efficient bus services can encourage more people to choose public transportation rather than private transportation, reducing traffic congestion. 

- *Improved Commuter Experience* - Real-time updates and accurate information can enhance the overall commuter experience.

- *Economic Benefits* - Efficient public transport systems can boost local economies by facilitating better access to jobs, education, and services.
